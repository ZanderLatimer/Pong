Add funky shaped paddles that bounce the ball in weird directions
Maybe add funky shaped ball

Scale objects with application size

If two keys are pressed at the same time, make paddles non stationary

Paddles do not move at the same rate. Maybe something to do with the game loop? Untie gameloop from graphics loop

Move ball and paddle to controller to be sent from controller to gamestate
